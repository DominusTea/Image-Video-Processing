##Exercise 2: Deep Learning on CIFAR-100.    
- In the first part of this exercise, different architectures are optimized and compared on their results.  
- In the second part of this exercise, we use overfitting prevention techniques and compare the results with those of the first part.  
- In the third part of this exercise, we use transfer learning (for the best architecture so far).
